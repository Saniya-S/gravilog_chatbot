# GraviLog Chatbot
This is a proactive AI-powered chatbot that helps expectant mothers understand their symptoms and assess potential pregnancy risks. The bot asks focused questions, uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to pull insights from a trusted knowledge base, and provides a structured risk level with suggestions.

## Problem Description
Many expectant mothers experience symptoms that can feel concerning but may not always require urgent care. GraviLog Bot aims to help by proactively triaging the situation through simple symptom-related questions, retrieving relevant information from trusted medical resources, and returning a clear risk assessment in a supportive, easy-to-understand manner.

The medical knowledge used to run this application is entirely from the official knowledge base provided by the GraviLog team.

## System Architecture
The chatbot is built using a straightforward RAG workflow:

1. Proactive Symptom Collection: The chatbot asks short questions about the user‚Äôs current symptoms.

2. RAG Backend: User responses are processed through LlamaIndex, which searches the indexed medical documents.

3. LLM Output: The relevant context is sent to Cohere‚Äôs LLM to generate a structured risk assessment.

4. Frontend: The conversation and results are displayed in an interactive Streamlit app.

## Example Queries and Outputs

The chatbot proactively asks a total of 11 questions. Apart from the first question, the order is shuffled for each session. Below is an example scenario with sample responses:

```

**Sample Structured Risk Assessment Output**

```
Risk Level: High üî¥

Explanation:
You are experiencing symptoms that could indicate preeclampsia and fetal distress, which are serious conditions. These symptoms include swelling in your hands and feet, a persistent headache, and reduced fetal movement. This combination of symptoms warrants immediate medical attention.
Suggestions:

    - Contact your healthcare provider or obstetrician right away. Describe your symptoms and concerns, especially the reduced fetal movement, persistent headache, and swelling.

    - Keep track of fetal movements and note any changes. This will help your healthcare provider assess the situation.

    - Stay hydrated and rest as much as possible. These measures can help manage symptoms and support your overall well-being.

Additional Notes

Remember, seeking medical attention is crucial to ensure the safety of both you and your baby. Your healthcare provider will assess your symptoms and provide appropriate guidance and care. Don't hesitate to reach out for support and advice.
```

The bot also supports simple follow-up questions, for example:
- ‚ÄúWhy should I stay hydrated?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhat should I do if I feel dizzy later?‚Äù


**Example Follow-up**

If you ask:
```
What do you mean it could indicate preeclampsia?
```
The bot responds:
```
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organs, often the kidneys. The symptoms you're experiencing, like swelling, headaches, and changes in fetal movement, can be indicators of this condition. It's a serious concern as it can affect both you and your baby's health. That's why it's crucial to get checked by your doctor as soon as possible. They will be able to monitor your blood pressure and run some tests to determine if you have preeclampsia and provide the necessary treatment.
